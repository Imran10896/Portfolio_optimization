## Functions

### MATLAB Functions

1. `financial_ratios`: Calculates financial ratios such as mean, standard deviation, and Sharpe ratio based on portfolio returns.
2. `financial_ratios_uniform`: Calculates financial ratios based on uniformly weighted portfolio returns.
3. `market_uniform`: Calculates financial ratios for investing in the whole market with uniformly weighted portfolio returns.
4. `market_markowitz`: Calculates financial ratios for investing in the whole market using Markowitz portfolio optimization.
5. `core_fin_ratios`: Calculates financial ratios for portfolio construction through core stocks.

### Python Scripts

1. `coreness_Rossa.py`: Computes coreness centrality using the method proposed by Rossa et al.
2. `coreness_Rombach.py`: Computes coreness centrality using the method proposed by Rombach et al.
3. `cp_centralization.py`: Computes centralization of a network using the core-periphery model.
